lexicon = list of allowable words.

Direction: north, south, east, west, down, up, left, right, back

Verbs: go, stop, kill, eat

stop words: the, in, of, from, at, it

Nouns: door, bear, princess, cabinet

Numbers: any string of 0 through 9 characters

Our definition of a sentence >>> words separated by spaces.

so to break up words into a sentence...
(ex48.py)

stuff = input('> ')
words = stuff.split()

tuple = list that you can't modify.

form of these is (TOKEN, WORD)
...
first_word = ('verb', 'go')
second_word = ('direction', 'north')
third_word = ('direction', 'west')
sentence = [first_word, second_word, third_word]


WRITING A SCANNER:

Taking a user's input (raw string) and returning a sentence that's composed of tuples
with (TOKEN, WORD) pairings.
If a word isn't part of the lexicon, then it should still return the WORD but set the
TOKEN to an error token.
